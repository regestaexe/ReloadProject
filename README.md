ReloadProject
=============

The ReLoad project (Repository for Linked open archival data) will foster experimentation with the technology and methods of linked open data for archival resources. Its goal is the creation of a web of linked archival data.
LOD-LAM, which is an acronym for Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums, is an umbrella term for the community and active projects in this area.
The first experimental phase will make use of W3C semantic web standards, mash-up techniques, software for linking and for defining the semantics of the data in the selected databases.
The archives that have made portions of their institutionsâ€™ data and databases openly available for this project are the Central State Archive, and the Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region. These will be used to test methodologies to expose the resources as linked open data.
This project is supported by the follow organizations:

    Archivio Centrale dello Stato
    Istituto Beni Culturali Regione Emilia Romagna
